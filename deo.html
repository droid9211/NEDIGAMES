            identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I
            will be able to do necessary actions.</p>
